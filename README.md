# Conditional scene generation

Conditional scene generation aims to create a model that could generate realistic road scenarios with the ability to control certain conditions (e.g number of vehicles, minimum/mean distance to the ego vehicle). The model will be trained on the NuScenes dataset for vehicle and map data.
